## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my GitHub! I work at the intersection of neuroscience and computational modeling, exploring nociceptive processing and network dynamics in the PFC, ACC, and S1 in pigs.  

### ðŸ”¬ What I Do  
- Investigate neural stimulation and recording techniques  
- Develop computational models for fiber activation  
- Work on surgical approaches in porcine neuroscience research  

### ðŸš€ Interests  
- Neural data analysis & deep learning models for neuroscience  
- Experimental neuroscience & neuromodulation  
- Rock climbing, hiking, and road trips when I'm not deep in data  

### ðŸ“« Get in Touch  
Feel free to reach out if you're interested in neuroscience, modeling, or just want to chat about climbing spots!

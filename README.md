# 🐷🔬 Porcine Brain Explorer

Hey—thanks for dropping by! I’m a neuroscientist digging into the **porcine brain** to figure out how pain signals move through the PFC, ACC, and S1.

## 🚧 What I’m Up To
- **Mapping pig brain circuits** and fine‑tuning in‑vivo recording methods  
- **Coding models** that predict which nerve fibers fire during stimulation  
- **Designing surgical techniques** made for large‑animal neuroscience  

## 🧠 Stuff I Nerd Out On
- Crunching neural data & training deep‑learning models on pig recordings  
- Building neuromodulation tools that are gentle on brain tissue  
- Away from the bench: rock climbing 🧗, long hikes 🏔️, and spontaneous road trips 🚐  

## 📫 Say Hi
Got ideas about porcine neuroscience—or a climbing spot I shouldn’t miss? Let’s chat!

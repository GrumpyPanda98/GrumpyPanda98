# 🔬 Neuroscience Researcher

Hey—thanks for dropping by! I’m a computational neuroscientist digging into pain neuroplasticity

## 🧠 What I’m Up To
- **Mapping brain circuits** and fine‑tuning in‑vivo recording methods  
- **Computational models** that predict how nerve fibers fire during spinal cord stimulation
- **Designing surgical implantation protocols** made for large‑animal neuroscience 

## 🤓 Stuff I Nerd Out On
- Cognitive neuroscience & psychology—attention, memory, decision‑making, consciousness
- Training and tinkering with deep‑learning models—from classic CNNs to cutting‑edge transformers (and whatever comes next)
- Open‑source science: reproducible code, data sharing, and scientific visualization
- When I unplug: rock climbing 🧗, long hikes 🏔️, and spontaneous road trips 🚐

## 📫 DM me!
Got any cool ideas new (or old) computational methods for analyzing cortical signals or a climbing spot I shouldn’t miss? Let’s chat!

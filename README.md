# 🔬 Neuroscience Researcher

Hey—thanks for dropping by! I’m a computational neuroscientist digging into pain neuroplasticity

## 🚧 What I’m Up To
- **Mapping brain circuits** and fine‑tuning in‑vivo recording methods  
- **Computational models** that predict which nerve fibers fire during stimulation for spinal cord stimulation
- **Designing surgical implantation protocols** made for large‑animal neuroscience 

## 🧠 Stuff I Nerd Out On
- Processing and Analyzing neural data 
- Training deep‑learning models for classification on pain paradigms
- Away from the office: rock climbing 🧗, long hikes 🏔️, and spontaneous road trips 🚐  

## 📫 DM me!
Got any cool ideas new (or old) computational methods for analyzing cortical signals or a climbing spot I shouldn’t miss? Let’s chat!
